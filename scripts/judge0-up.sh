Full Judge0 sandboxing requires one of these supported runtimes:
- Linux x86_64 host
- Apple Silicon macOS with the '$PROFILE' Colima profile running as x86_64 and exposing cgroup v1

Current host: $(host_os) $(host_arch)
Current guest arch: $guest_arch_label
Current guest cgroup mode: $guest_cgroup_label

Bring the Colima profile into the supported shape or use a Linux x86_64 VM, then run:
  npm run judge0:up
  npm run judge0:test-sandbox
